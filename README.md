# GODI-For-All

# The Problem
The Ghana Open Data Initiative (GODI) is a website that hosts public national data about Ghana, a country in West Africa. The data was made available online to improve the public's understanding and use of government information to support the nation's growth and governance. The GODI has not been used often and the public does not know about the GODI according to published research. Also, the number of datasets available online has dropped since it first was first introduced in 2012. The GODI has been promoted heavily within the government and technology sectors, but that promotion has not translated into greater public use. To date, less than 5 peer-reviewed papers have used the GODI. The GODI has a lot of untapped value to support collaborative development in addition to the public's understanding of what their government. 


# History
The GODI was created in 2012 by the National Information Technology Agency, a government technology agency. GODI currently holds "133 public datasets from 25 agencies". The GODI includes information about argriculture, population statistics, and internet access, to name a few of the datasets. To access the GODI visit http://data.gov.gh/. 


# A Solution
To create an educational and awareness tooklit to promote the use of GODI in higher education academic institutions with a particular focus on schools of social work. The social work schools that will targeted for use of the toolkit are schools in Ghana and U.S.A schools of social work that offer study abroad programs in Ghana. The goal is to increase the use of GODI and to grow the open data eco-system in Ghana.

3. Suggest mobile-friendly software that can host the toolkit in various languages.
